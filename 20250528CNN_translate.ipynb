      "\n",
      "It was this image of Stanislav – alongside similar snaps of his sister Tamara, 12, and brother Roman, 17 – that was put on display at a makeshift memorial at their school in Korostyshiv and shared on social media after the three siblings died when a Russian strike hit their home over the weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trio was among at least 14 civilians killed over the weekend in the latest wave of Moscow’s escalating aerial assaults against Ukrainian cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts say the brutal campaign is part of a deliberate strategy by Russia that is designed to create an impression that it has the upper hand in the conflict, undermine Ukraine’s morale and put more pressure on Kyiv’s Western allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia first began intensifying airborne attacks against Ukraine last fall, after it successfully scaled up domestic production of its own version of the Iranian-made Shahed drones, its most frequently used drone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the frequency and scale of these strikes increased again in January, after US President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Five of Russia’s biggest drone attacks were all launched since then. Four of the five came over the past 10 days, according to a tally compiled by CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine one of his priorities – having said during the election campaign that he would bring the conflict to an end within 24 hours of taking office.\n",

      "Photos shared by the Gustav Olizar Lyceum in Korostyshiv show Stanislav, Tamara and Roman Martynyuk, three siblings killed by a Russian strike. Gustav Olizar Lyceum in Korostyshiv\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite the promises, Trump seems to have grown increasingly impatient with Moscow and Kyiv. He has been flip-flopping between threatening to punish Russia with more sanctions if it doesn’t sign up to a ceasefire proposal and suggesting he could walk away from the issue altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the weekend, after Russia launched its biggest aerial assault against Ukraine since the start of the war, Trump said on social media that Putin “has gone absolutely CRAZY!” before telling reporters that he was “not happy with what Putin is doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Trump also slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for suggesting that “America’s silence” encourages Putin to continue his onslaught. He said Zelensky does his country disservice because “everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that should Ukraine “misbehave” in fighting against Russia with drones, it will “get hurt.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The only way to win\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said that Russia’s brutal aerial campaign is part of the strategy to create the illusion that it is winning the war, in an “effort to degrade Ukrainian morale and convince the West that a Russian victory in Ukraine is inevitable and that supporting Ukraine is futile.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin knows that the only way Russia could win the war in Ukraine any time soon is if Ukraine’s Western allies, the United States chief among them, stop supporting Kyiv in its war efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukraine’s European allies have seen an increase in instances of sabotage, cyber incidents and arson attacks linked to Russia, an attempt by Moscow to put more pressure on Kyiv-friendly governments by trying to show their voters that supporting Kyiv comes with a cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Putin is successfully stalling the ceasefire talks proposed by Trump – while trying to appear cooperative and shift the blame on Kyiv.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of refusing Trump’s ceasefire proposal straight away, the Russian president has been introducing new demands and blaming Kyiv for not accepting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When given an ultimatum, Putin ignored it and called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia – something Trump immediately endorsed, blindsiding Ukraine’s other Western allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has repeatedly indicated he does not want US military assistance to Kyiv to continue as it was. Earlier this year, the US briefly suspended shipments of aid to Ukraine over Trump’s disagreement with Zelensky. While the aid has been reinstated, the incident gave a clear indication to Putin that Trump is willing to abandon Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has also made it clear he believed Ukraine is on the backfoot. He even told Zelensky he had “no cards” during the contentious Oval Office meeting in February, trying to pressure the Ukrainian leader into negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while Russia does have air superiority over Ukraine, which allows Moscow to terrorize the Ukrainian population on daily basis, it is far from “winning” the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti previously told CNN that the situation on the ground in Ukraine is better described as both sides losing. “The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Russia launched its full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin expected to take over the country within a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "That has not happened because Ukraine mounted a surprisingly strong defense. And as Western support for Kyiv increased, Ukraine was able to push back and reclaim large swaths of territory that were seized by Russia during the initial invasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frontline in Ukraine has not moved in a significant way since Ukrainian forces liberated the southern city of Kherson in November 2023. Russia has advanced in some areas along the frontline, but it has not been able to break through or take over a major city.\n",

      "Athens CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Climbing to the top of the Acropolis of Athens, the birthplace of democracy, has always been a feat for the brave. Never more so, perhaps, than in recent summers when the city has sweated through long and perilous heatwaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past two years, during peak tourism season, relentless heat has repeatedly forced authorities to shut Greece’s most-visited site during the hottest hours of the day to protect visitors and staff from temperatures exceeding 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n",
      "\n",
      "The UNESCO World Heritage site has little shade. Standing among the exquisitely-crafted white marble columns of the Parthenon as they reflect the fierce Mediterranean sun can feel more like an endurance test than the fulfillment of a childhood dream — especially when the smoke from out-of-control wildfires drifts across the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s not just the Acropolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athens has always been scorching in the summer, but never to current levels. It’s the hottest capital in mainland Europe but witnessed record highs in 2024, a situation that’s becoming the new normal. The Mediterranean as a whole is warming up faster than the global average.\n",
      "\n",
      "With travel to Greece booming, officials say Athens is forecast to welcome a record 10 million visitors this year. Those arriving in July and August will be on a collision course with yet more extreme temperatures, predicts the country’s national weather service, creating a perfect storm of tourism and scorching weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation has raised existential questions for Greece and its relationship with the visitors whose spending power has helped the country out of crisis during financially turbulent times. Increased tourism means increased pressure on scarce water resources and infrastructure. It also means inflation, pushing locals out in favor of wealthy incomers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A much-talked-about opinion article in the Greek press suggested that the country’s single-minded pursuit of maximum tourism no longer made sense, and that Greeks were in danger of losing their birthright. “Starkly put, we are bequeathing the subsequent generations of Greeks not just a massive pile of debt, but also a summerless Greece,” it said. Trepidation about the months ahead, when the sun will once again bake down, is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, amid the fear, there is certainly hope — and a realization that the country must adapt or face disastrous consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the mayor of Athens, Haris Doukas, “building resilience is a matter of survival.” Managing those high temperatures alongside the surge in summer tourists has become a priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "An urban heat sink\n",
      "\n",
      "A thermometer shows 44 degrees Celsius in Athens on July 18, 2024. Louisa Gouliamaki/Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "In the short-term, that means early-warning systems for heatwaves and real-time monitoring of temperature data, along with fountains, air-conditioned cooling centers and shady pocket parks are all in place to provide relief. Emergency services have been put at the ready, including around the foothills of the Acropolis, to assist visitors experiencing discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tourists often underestimate the heat, especially those from colder climates,” says Iris Plaitakis, a tour guide who regularly visits the Acropolis. “They don’t think to wear hats or bring enough water. You’re much more exposed to the sun and heat up there because of the higher elevation and lack of trees and other shade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Extreme heat is incredibly dangerous. “Heatwaves are responsible for more than 80% of deaths caused by weather and climate events in Europe,” says Ine Vandecasteele, a European Environment Agency urban adaptation expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the longer term, Athens faces the challenge of reshaping a city that has become a concrete heat sink with limited green spaces — it’s one of the least green cities in Europe and the second-most densely populated after Paris. To complicate things, Greece, and Athens in particular, is home to one of the oldest populations in Europe, a demographic at risk from extreme heat.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2021, the city became Europe’s first to appoint a dedicated “chief heat officer” to promote and coordinate adaption and resilience strategies, as it began focusing on nature-based solutions to reduce the heat-island effect, which sees cities becoming much hotter than the surrounding natural environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In just over a year we have planted 7,000 trees which is difficult in such a densely built city. We want that number to reach 28,000 in four years. We are also establishing green corridors,” says Doukas, the Athens mayor. “Athens is rethinking urban infrastructure, redesigning roads and selecting heat-absorbing materials.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Resilience-building initiatives include the creation of detailed heatwave maps that enable targeted interventions. Among them is the creation of a microforest, Greece’s first, in Kypseli, Europe’s most densely populated neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The goal is to lower perceived temperatures by 5 degrees Celsius within five years by creating targeted microclimates,” says Doukas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the leafy Chalandri suburb, the revitalization of a second-century Roman aqueduct to irrigate green spaces and cool neighborhoods has gained much attention. “The aqueduct transports water that would otherwise go to waste,” says project manager Christos Giovanopoulos. “When the new pipelines are operational this summer, we’ll save 80,000-100,000 cubic meters annually.”\n",

      "Tourists cool off under a mist of water during a heat wave on July 20, 2023 in Athens. Milos Bicanski/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavily built up and covered in graffiti, modern Athens bears little resemblance to the idyllic location people chose to settle millennia ago. Back then it offered proximity to both mountains and the sea, a mild climate, verdant and abundant resources and flowing rivers — the same waterways that were concreted over during rapid urbanization in the 1950s and 1960s to build highways.\n",
      "\n",
      "And some of that concrete will now have to go, says Juanjo Galan, an associate professor of urban planning at Spain’s Technical University of Valencia, who has watched his own city undergo a green revolution, being named European Green Capital 2024 for its achievements in green transition and climate neutrality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In Spain, we say you cannot make an omelet without breaking some eggs,” says Galan. “Like Valencia, Athens will have to break some concrete, invest in green infrastructure and heat-absorbing materials. It will take some time but can be done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One major project already underway is reconnecting Athens with the sea that defines so much of life in the rest of Greece.\n",
      "\n",
      "With enchanting ancient wonders and picturesque jasmine-scented alleyways in its historic center, it is easy for visitors to forget that Athens is actually very close to the Greek coast and many beautiful coves and beaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riviera escape\n",
      "\n",
      "Many Athenians head to the nearby coast to keep cool during summer. Yorgos Karahalis/AP\n",
      "\n",
      "Athenians have always known this, often heading out of town to cool down. And now their city is following suit, expanding along the waterfront, revamping an area recently branded The Athens Riviera.

      "On one hand, they’re seen as a lifeblood. During the 2010s, when Athens was the epicenter of a painful financial crisis that saw Greece’s GDP slashed by a quarter, it was tourism that brought the economy back. On the other hand, Athenians have found themselves increasingly priced out by gentrification partly driven by tourism, and are concerned about the impact of the industry on a city stretched to the limits by extreme heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real estate prices along the coast have hit the roof, with many prime Athens properties now in the hands of big international investors and others transformed into boutique hotels and global luxury chains that pull in more visitors. Those same hotels are installing aircon and swimming pools to keep their guests cool in a city with already stretched power and water supplies.\n",

      "Many Athenians are anxious about the summer ahead, with official reports about falling reservoir water levels regularly making the TV news. The situation is exacerbated by the extensive wildfires that have destroyed 40% of forested areas around their city in less than a decade — the blazes fanned by similar, windy conditions seen in the recent Los Angeles fires and, like in LA, worsened by man-made climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, with tourism still a key economic driver, Greece must continue to tap the industry while trying not to get burned. And despite the challenges facing Athens and the rest of the country, tourists are expected to keep coming. A record 36 million came in 2024, over three times the country’s population. Data analysts Fitch Solutions says the number is expected to hit 40 million by 2030.\n",

      "“People come from all over the world to understand, and experience, the cradle of Western civilization, to see where Aristotle and Plato walked, where the first modern Olympics were held,” says Plaitakis, the archaeological guide. “This cannot be recreated.

      "As with other overtouristed destinations around the world, Athens is hoping to try to funnel some of its peak summer-season tourism into shoulder or even off-peak times\n",
      "\n",
      "Mild temperatures in spring and early fall present an ideal opportunity to explore the city’s landmark sites, vibrant art scene and fun-loving, laid-back culture. And with colder months also becoming milder, Athens is a growing winter destination, mostly for northern Europeans, hungry for olive-oil-drenched Greek-salad-and-moussaka days and fresh-fish-and-ouzo nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athens’ efforts to keep cool can already be seen. In the historic center, tourists are learning to drink their iced coffee like locals, nice and slow — a cooling companion to see them through the hottest part of the day. At information points, smiling young women advise tourists, in polished English, to purchase tickets to the Acropolis in advance to avoid long lines and the midday sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Acropolis is temporarily off limits due to extreme heat, Plaitakis suggests heading to “the top three” as a cooler option: The Acropolis Museum, the National Archaeological Museum and the Museum of Cycladic Art.\n",
      "\n",
      "To take in some coastal views, she advises to “start at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, designed by the great Renzo Piano, and stop for a dip and a Greek taverna lunch at one of the many beaches on the way to the magnificent Temple of Poseidon, a sunset destination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As daylight dwindles, and temperatures cool down, the city’s energy rises around an outdoor culture that features open-air cinemas, live performances and a vibrant nightlife. Greeks are famously late-night eaters and known to occupy every available space at bars, beaches and benches waiting for their city to cool down. A form of climate adaptation by default. A Mediterranean way of life that needs to up its game in a time of climate emergency. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

In the same decade, there was a surprisingly artistic print artwork for the sixth season of the popular 2005 CBS TV show “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”. In the ad, cast members gaze through the window of a neon-lit diner lifted straight out of American painter Edward Hopper’s seminal painting “Nighthawks” (1942).\n",

      "Each of the campaigns may appear to have little in common, but they reveal an unmistakable truth about the advertising industry: before digital marketing became the norm, overtaking print in terms of revenue and budget allocation, there was arguably more room for complex, creative and daring image-making. Jim Heimann, graphic designer, historian and the editor of the forthcoming book “All-American Ads of the 2000s” — available in the UK from April 14 and in the US a month later — is worried these might be the last of their kind. “Print is slowly disappearing. That’s a problem,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The material isn’t there anymore’\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a skilled archaeologist, Heimann has spent his life hunting down and preserving American cultural relics, such as cocktail napkins collected while researching the country’s penchant for drive-in restaurants to travel brochures from the early 20th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fixture at Sunday flea markets for the last 50 years, Heimann finds they are a good location to scour for magazines — often the first thing to go following a home clearout, he said. He normally turns to eBay to source specific ads, despite the added cost, and takes care to cherry pick from across pop culture, selecting the most artfully designed campaigns for top movies, popular games and even beloved cereal brands, among others. With each decision, he’s thinking: “What would I want to revisit 20 years from now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All-American Ads of the 2000s\" Courtesy Taschen\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2000, Heimann was commissioned by Taschen to create a series of books that mapped the visual fluctuations of the advertising industry. He started with the 1950s, a post-war period often referred to as the golden age of capitalism in the US, sourcing John Wayne-fronted Camel ads, glossy Cadillac double-page spreads and kitschy lingerie illustrations. Then he went back to the ‘30s, the ‘40s and jumped forward to the ‘60s, following each decade until the last tome cataloging the Wild West of the ‘90s hit the shelves in 2022. This edition on the aughts, however, will likely conclude the collection. “We had a discussion about doing 2010 to 2020,” Heimann told CNN in a video call. “But the material just isn’t there anymore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chronicling the earlier part of the decade has proved difficult. As the book’s foreword by Steven Heller, former senior art director of the New York Times, reads: “Advertising did not change when the Times Square ball fell at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000, but the industry began its creative decline in the 2000s” — a period when digital advertising was starting to creep in. When Google launched its AdWords platform in 2000, small businesses could eschew forking out for expensive visual campaigns and instead promote themselves on Google’s search results page with text-based adverts. By 2001, television had surpassed newspapers in terms of ad revenue for the first time in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "These developments mark “the end of a century of advertising,” said Heimann.\n",

      "Societal shifts\n",
      "\n",
      "For Heimann, ads offer insight into the values and aspirations as well as political and economic environments of a generation. On compiling them in the book, he explained: “We always have a staple of 10 categories, but we expand them according to the decades. For instance, in the 1940s we had to expand war-related ads. They were really predominant, all these companies that were no longer producing automobiles or tires were doing everything for the war effort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the aughts, many of the ads were focused on technology. “The tech world just blew up,” Heimann said. “Everything fell into that (category) consistently.” It was the 10-year-period that saw the invention of the first ever iPhone, the iMac, the iBook, the MacBook, the iPad, the iPod, iPod Nano and iPod Mini — and that’s just Apple. Heimann also found old Motorola, Blackberry, Sony and Nokia ads, along with a slew of brands that are no longer in existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Motorola RAZR was a cultural phenomenon in the 2000s, and its ads often nodded to music and aspirational lifestyles. Courtesy Taschen\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid a shift in societal attitudes towards sexuality and sexual freedom, the concept of “sex sells” became a common marketing strategy in the ‘70s — so much so that it would be difficult to tell the difference between a Dolce & Gabbana campaign and an ad for Durex, said Heimann. Sexual marketing imagery continues to be prevalent, despite advertising’s changing tides (see Jeremy Allen White’s racy Calvin Klein underwear campaign in 2024, which Heimann sought to collect but failed to find a print copy, even after searching through 15 men’s magazines at his local newsstand).\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Gucci ad from 2002, a topless male model is photographed side-on, undoing the monogrammed belt of his ‘G’ embroidered jeans — the leather strap in-hand creating a “sophomoric suggestion of an enhanced male appendage,” wrote Heller in the book. A Tom Ford menswear shoot Heimann preserved from 2008 shows an entirely naked female model grabbing the crotch of a suited man. “Females are always exploited,” he pointed out. “But to the extent of how they exploit women just becomes (implausible).”\n",
      "\n",
      "At least the French brand Sisley somewhat evened the score, with an advert of a nude man saddled up and being ridden by a fully clothed woman. Still, to Heimann, this level of sexualization is “toned down” compared to the material he has collected from the ‘80s and ‘90s. “Now, we’ve got this new era of hyper masculinity,” Heimann said, referring to Trump’s hypermasculine campaign messaging that called for a return of gender roles, as well as the rise of “manosphere” influencers such as Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan, who push male-supremacist viewpoints and call for the subservience of women on platforms such as YouTube. “Where’s that going to take us?” he questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The future of ads\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the leaps in AI technology and the new US administration, Heimann has questions not only on what adverts in the future might look like, but also who might be making them in the first place. It’s unlikely advertisers will want to spend on an agency to deliver a campaign when they can create them using AI for a fraction of the price. A recent study conducted by the University of Oxford suggests that AI-generated advertising images performed more effectively than human-made ones, as long as the images used do not look like artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 2000s, Boost Mobile's ad campaigns often featured hip-hop artists, emphasizing affordability and a youth-oriented image. Courtesy Taschen\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where will that creative world go?” Heimann mused. “It’ll have to play out, but it doesn’t bode well.” A fixation on cutting costs might only become greater in light of President Donald Trump’s anti-European initiatives and the recently announced 25% tariffs on imported cars among other products. “How do you sell a car that’s 25% more (expensive) than another car?” Heimann asked. “Who’s going to buy a Subaru (or) a Volvo (if they) charge 25% more than an American car?”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Heimann, advertisements of the last two decades have been selling a steady version of the American Dream. “In the ‘90s and the early 2000s, advertising still has that same cadence to it. The population looks the same, the automobiles look the same,” he said. Now, Heimann thinks that as America continues to evolve, more monumental changes will come in the years ahead. “I’ve been asked the question, ‘Did 9/11 affect advertising and how people perceived it?’ I think there was a little bump (in the road)… But I think what’s happening currently is going to be much more impactful,” he said.\n",

      "Apartment owners at a luxury New York skyscraper are suing the building’s developers over a “far-reaching fraud” in which they allegedly hid structurally significant defects — including “thousands” of severe cracks on the tower’s facade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The condo board at 432 Park Avenue, a super-skinny high-rise on Manhattan’s Billionaire’s Row, claims that real estate firm CIM Group failed to disclose the extent of damage that has resulted in flooding and impacted the value of their multimillion-dollar properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Filed at the state court in New York in late April, the lawsuit also names architecture and engineering companies involved in the project. Condo owners are collectively seeking more than $165 million in damages, according to the complaint.\n",

      "The world's tallest residential building until 2020, the slender tower has a has a 15:1 height-to-width ratio. Gary Hershorn/Corbis/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Completed in 2015, the slender 1,396-foot-tall skyscraper has a 15:1 height-to-width ratio, putting it among the so-called “pencil towers” now dotting midtown Manhattan’s skyline. To protect against high winds, the building was designed with unoccupied floors that encourage airflow, anchors drilled deep into the bedrock and “tuned mass dampers” that act like pendulums to counteract swaying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Property developer Harry Macklowe — whose firm McGraw Hudson Construction Corp is also named in the suit — compared the tower to the Empire State Building, telling the New York Times in 2013 that it was “the building of the 21st century.” Pop star Jennifer Lopez and Chinese businessman Ye Jianming are among those reported to have purchased units there for eight-figure sums.\n",
      "\n",
      "But owners and residents have since complained of numerous construction issues, including more than 20 water leaks since 2017, according to the complaint. In 2021, the condo board filed a lawsuit alleging a range of defects, from malfunctioning elevators and poor energy efficiency to a trash chute that sounds “like a bomb” when used.\n",

      "\n",
      "The new lawsuit meanwhile claims that the tower’s facade is “plagued with thousands of severe cracks, spalling, and other forms of deterioration,” including a 10-inch-deep crack in the building’s core. As well as causing flooding, the damage has corroded some of the steel in the tower’s reinforced concrete columns, the complaint alleges.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the 2021 complaint also detailed “substantial cracking,” the condo board said it filed its most recent action after claiming it uncovered evidence that defendants had “conspired” to conceal the extent and seriousness of the defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In statements provided to CNN, both CIM Group and SLCE Architects, the project’s architect of record, said they “vehemently” deny the claims and are moving to have the complaint dismissed. Engineering firm WSP declined to comment. McGraw Hudson Construction Corp did not respond to CNN’s inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawsuit attributes cracking to the building’s “experimental” facade, which is made from white concrete. The material is, it says, “typically used for aesthetic purposes” and had to be strengthened to withstand the supertall building’s structural load — especially during high winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the suit’s allegations are claims that CIM Group ignored concerns raised by various concrete consultants, as well as the project’s late architect Rafael Viñoly about the strength of the concrete mix. The condo board claims that mockup tests showed the material’s use would result in cracking. But CIM Group and its contractors “bulled forward” with “complete disregard for… the inevitable problems it would cause for the building and its future residents,” the suit adds.\n",

      "The 432 Park Avenue tower seen reflected in the glass of another skyscraper in Manhattan, New York. Seth Wenig/AP\n",
      "\n",
      "The condo board alleges that, despite having knowledge of the facade’s defects, SLCE Architects deceived condo owners by making “materially false” claims in its offering plan, a document disclosing important information to potential buyers. (The lawsuit cites an alleged change in the document’s wording, which went from claiming the concrete “will” prevent water penetration to saying that it was only “designed to” do so.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that McGraw Hudson and WSP misled New York City Department of Buildings in a letter that “misrepresented the nature, extent, and type of cracking.” It claims the letter failed to disclose the full findings of a survey that had discovered 1,893 defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint claims that developers then “repeatedly rejected” recommendations on how to address issues that arose. A suggestion that an opaque elastomeric covering could be applied to the facade to prevent air and water infiltration, for instance, was ignored because it would “significantly alter” the building’s appearance and make it less appealing to “the world’s billionaires,” the lawsuit alleges. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
